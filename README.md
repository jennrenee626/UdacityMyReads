# MyReads Project

To get started developing right away:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## How to Use
On the main page, user can click on arrow on bottom right of book to change the shelf the book is on. User can click plus on bottom right to search and add additional books to these shelves.

## Backend Server
A backend server exists in the provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js). This file contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
